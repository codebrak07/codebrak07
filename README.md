## 🚀 About Me

I build structured learning systems and clean frontend interfaces.

Currently focused on:
- JavaScript fundamentals & deep DOM understanding
- DSA in Python

My approach to development is rooted in **logic, structured thinking, and clean design principles**.  
Alongside backend architecture, I’m actively improving my UI/UX skills to build systems that are both functional and intuitive.

⚡ I treat coding the same way I approach aptitude and logic challenges — analyze first, execute precisely.
